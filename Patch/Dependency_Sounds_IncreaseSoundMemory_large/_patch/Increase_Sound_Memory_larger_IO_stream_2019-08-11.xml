<!-- Increasing the sound values for the wwise sound engine -->

<!-- increase the maximum limit of ram that the game *should* allocate.
     it only complains in the python log if it is exceded.
     It looks to be used for WG to maintain minimum system requirements. -->
<!-- memoryLimit - This is the maximum amount of memory, in MB, that WoT is told that it should allocate to the wwise sound engine.
     Budyx69 recommends that the value is not set above 250MB. -->

     Budyx69 recommends the value of 24. It should be noted here that we may not need to increase the value to this much,
     as Budy has many sounds streaming from disk. -->
